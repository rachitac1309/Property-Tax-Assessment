# Property-Tax-Assessment
Predict assessed property value for the purpose of property tax assessment.

Here, we have data of properties collected by a Municipal Council for the purpose of computation of assessed value and 
assessment of property tax within the framework of state laws. An individual tax lot may range from multiple buildings 
to just one residential or commercial unit in a condominium. Assessed value depends on the variables such as location, 
building class for understanding constructive use, area (land and/or buildup), year of construction etc. Location can 
be measured by certain data elements like ZIP code, longitudinal, latitudinal measures etc.
The Municipal council is facing the problem of many citizens challenging the assessment of property taxes and is 
criticized for complicated assessment procedure system as well as multiple required filings throughout the year to 
challenge oneâ€™s assessment. Therefore, the Council wants to rationalise the tax assessment system. They also want to 
structure benefit programs based on certain variables of statistical significance to incentivise additional construction 
activity or activity of conversion/modification of properties for reducing tax burden and/or to make the contemplated
projects more economically feasible.
Therefore the idea is to achieve consistent, rational and objective assessment of properties based on a predictive 
model by automating the property valuation process to reduce the unfairness within the tax system.

# Error Metric : MAPE

The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is one of the most commonly used KPIs to measure forecast accuracy.
MAPE is the sum of the individual absolute errors divided by the demand (each period separately). It is the average 
of the percentage errors.Once the absolute percent error for each data entry, calculate the MAPE. 
Add all the absolute percent errors together, then divide the sum by the number of errors.
